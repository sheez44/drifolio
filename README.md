# drifolio

I tried to replicate the website of drifolio*. I liked the design and some other features like the fading in of the navbar and the custom scrollbar. I created a custom html file, SASS files and javascript code. I tried to build the site as much as possible on my own without looking at the source code.

*Drifolio stands for Dribbble-Portolio. This is a free HTML template designed and coded by Mamun Srizon.
